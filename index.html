    <h2>Question 1: Article on Illegal Mining</h2>
    <p>
        Illegal mining has been a persistent problem in our area, leading to numerous negative effects. Firstly, it causes severe environmental degradation. The landscape is scarred with open pits, and the water bodies are contaminated with harmful chemicals used in mining. This not only destroys the natural beauty but also affects agriculture and local livelihoods. Secondly, illegal mining operations are often unsafe, resulting in frequent accidents and loss of lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        To control illegal mining, stricter enforcement of laws is necessary. The government should increase patrols and monitoring of mining areas. Additionally, raising awareness about the long-term consequences of illegal mining among the local communities can help discourage this practice.

    <h2>Question 2: Letter to Headmaster</h2>
    <p>Dear Headmaster,</p>
    <p>
        I am writing to suggest two ways of improving discipline in our school. Firstly, implementing a reward system for good behavior can motivate students to adhere to school rules. Rewards such as certificates or small gifts can encourage positive conduct. Secondly, organizing regular counseling sessions can address underlying issues causing indiscipline. These sessions can provide students with guidance and support, helping them stay on the right path.

    <h2>Question 3: Speech to Fresh Students</h2>
    <p>
        Good day, fresh students! Welcome to our school. To make your stay here successful, I suggest three things. First, stay focused on your studies. Prioritize your academic work and avoid distractions. Second, participate in extracurricular activities. They help you develop new skills and make friends. Finally, respect your teachers and peers. A respectful attitude will create a positive environment for everyone.

            The parliament of Ghana is responsible for the passage of bills into law. The leadership of this organ comprises the speaker, his two deputies, and other leaders from the majority and minority sides of the house. Apart from these people, there is the clerk of parliament who is the principal advisor to the speaker and members on matters of privilege, practice, and procedure. Aside from the law-making role, parliament also has the responsibility of managing government budget.
